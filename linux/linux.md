## Distributions 

### How To Select
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iox7fr7p5Hc 
- starter: 
  - pop os (optimized for gaming, comes with drivers)
  - mint (issues with nvidea drivers)
  - ubuntu (too much 'not recommend' videos recently)
- stable (but runs a bit behind): 
  - debian (base repo)
  - fedora (desktop managed by red hat) 
    - package manager: `yum` or `dnf`, install even more with rmpfusion.org
- server: centos (mirrors `rel` - enterprise linux system manged by Red Hat)
- lightweight, access to latest packages, cumbersome installation
  - arch 
    - Arch User Repository (AUR) 
      - a community-driven repository containing package descriptions (PKGBUILD's) that allows users to compile packages from source.
      - if you don't use it then Arch is very stable, otherwise - make backups before installations
    - package manager `pacman`
  - manjaro (arch + gui)
    - package manager `pamac` + AUR
  - acro 

### Like MacOs
