### Configurable Code Splitting

  > My point is that when we write code we have no idea what the final bundles should look like and, therefore, don't have sufficient information to decide where to put the dynamic imports. On the other hand, by the time we collect sufficient data on what ideal chunks should look like the source code is already written. Inserting dynamically imports retroactively may be a huge undertaking.
