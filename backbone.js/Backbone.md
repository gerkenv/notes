### Backbone Demo Application

## Setup

1. Get a local copy of a project repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/gerkenv/FEF-UdaciMeals-Backbone
```
2. Install bower from [bower.io](bower.io)

3. Go to a project directory and run:
```
bower install
```
4. Clone a server repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/gerkenv/FEF-UdaciMeals-Backbone-Server
```
5. Go to a server directory and run:
```
cd ./binaries
